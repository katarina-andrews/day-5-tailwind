          is a large planet mostly composed of helium and/or hydrogen. These
          planets don’t have hard surfaces and instead have swirling gases above
          a solid core.

          Neptune is the eighth, and most distant planet from the Sun. It’s the
          fourth-largest, and the first planet discovered with math. The ice
          giant Neptune is more than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth.
          Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the
          naked eye. Its atmosphere (made up mostly of hydrogen, helium, and
          methane) extends to great depths, gradually merging into water and
          other melted ices over a heavier, solid core with about the same mass
          as Earth. Neptune has 16 known moons.

          Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet
          in our solar system. Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen
          and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are
          as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of
          moons. From the jets of water that spray from Saturn's moon
          Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan, the Saturn system is a
          rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries.

          Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and the third largest
          planet in our solar system. Uranus is very cold and windy. It is
          surrounded by faint rings, and more than two dozen small moons. It
          rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This
          unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side. Uranus was the
          first planet found with the aid of a telescope. Uranus' atmosphere is
          mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane and traces
          of water and ammonia. The methane gives Uranus its signature blue
          color.

          Jupiter is the largest and oldest planet in our solar system. If
          Jupiter was a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside. Jupiter has
          the shortest day in the solar system, taking about 9.9 hours to spin
          around once on its axis. Jupiter's signature stripes and swirls are
          actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an
          atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. The top cloud is probably made of
          ammonia ice, while the middle layer is likely made of ammonium
          hydrosulfide crystals. The innermost layer may be made of water ice
          and vapor. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger
          than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years. With four large moons
          and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar
          system.
